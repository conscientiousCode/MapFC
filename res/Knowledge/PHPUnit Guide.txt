This document is indtended to help developers get PHPUnit up and running
NOTE: ALL TESTS SHOULD END WITH "Test.php" for this guide to be 100% accurate


1. Getting PHPUnit
	-Go and download the phpunit.phar file from the internet. (version 4.8.36 works)
	-SAVE THIS FILE OUTSIDE OF THE GIT REPOSITORY or else we will be distributing it.

2. Configuring PHPUnit
	PHPUnit runs with a configuration file called 'phpunit.xml'.
	Our phpunit.xml is in the root/config
	NOTE: phpunit.xml specifies paths relative to its own file location
		So to access the folders a layer up from config,
		start your paths should look like ../pathFromFolderContainingPHPUnit.xml

	- To Add a TestSuite:
		Note, a TestSuite should only be created for a new logical component of the application
		- Be in <testsuites></testsuites>
		- Add in <testsuite name="yourNameHere"></testsuite>
	- To Add a Directory:
		-Be in a <testsuite></testsuite>
		-Add in <directory suffix="Test.php">directoryPathFromPHPUnit.xmlLocation</directory>
	- To Add a single file:
		-Be in a <testsuite></testsuite>
		-Add in <file>filePathFromPHPUnit.xmlLocation</file>

3. Configuring PHPStorm
	-Go to File>Settings>Languages & Frameworks>Test Frameworks
		-change the top option to "Path to Php.phar"
		- set "path to php.phar" to your path
		-Under 'Test Runner' check "Default Configuration file" and point to phpunit.xml
	-Create a new phpunit run configuration and check "TestScope: ... Defined in the Configuration file"
	-Add path to your php library as required. (Fix at the bottom may appear, and you can click that)

4. Writing Unit tests:
	- See any intro video to writting tests with phpstorm

Your tests should now run when it is select in PHPStorm
